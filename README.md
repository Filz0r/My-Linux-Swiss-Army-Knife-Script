# My-Linux-Swiss-Army-Knife-Script
  This is my first ever Python Script that is compressed in a bunch of small scripts that run with the help of a simple GUI, I use it to automate some tedious tasks on my everyday actions inside a command line, hope this serves as an inspiration for you to build yours!
